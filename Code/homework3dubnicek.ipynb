    "\n",
    "This homework begins by reviewing some things we accomplished in class, and defining some functions. Then it asks you to apply those functions to the Bechdel dataset. We won't fully replicate the data analysis performed in [the Bechdel article,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/) and spelled out (using R) in [this online analysis.](https://mran.microsoft.com/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/bechdel.html) But we're going to build some elements of the process from the ground up, so that we genuinely understand what's going on — especially where hypothesis testing is involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should say up front that the approach we're taking to hypothesis-testing here is only one of several possible approaches; it's based on what statisticians call a *frequentist* theory of statistics. *Bayesian* statistics provide an alternative way of reasoning about these questions; we'll glance at that in a couple of weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, let's test the significance of a correlation. We saw in class that movies that fail to pass the Bechdel test have lower median return-on-investment than those that do pass. This hints that movie studios may be controlled by a kind of sexism that is not only unjust, and not only not profitable, but actually self-destructive and money-*losing.* \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, I mentioned in class that there's a potential *confounding variable* in this argument. Movies with lower budgets generally have higher ROI. So perhaps movies that pass the Bechdel test have higher ROI simply *because* they have lower budgets? We won't completely resolve that question below, but we'll build up to it. To begin with, is the relationship between budget and return-on-investment actually meaningful, or would we be likely to see relations of that kind emerge by chance?\n",
    "\n",
    "To test that, we'll start by reconstructing the functions we need for a correlation test."

    "\n",
    "I'm not entirely sure we can infer a huge amount about sexism in the movie industry from this analysis, to be honest, but there are some very general findings that are concluded. It looks like movies with larger budgets do indeed tend to have a smaller ROI, and films that pass the Bechdel test do tend to have smller budgets. This could possibly mean either that studios/financiers are less likely to finance films that pass the Bechdel test, that films that pass the test are less likely to opt for studio financing, or even that they tend to be in genres that are less budget-intensive (i.e. drama, comedy, romance, etc.). Because of this, it's still unclear whether films with larger budgets ensured they passed the test would see larger ROIs. However, we are seeing that this effect only applies to U.S. and Canada ROIs, with international ROI evening out over the long-term.\n",
    "\n",
    "All-in-all, it's likely fair to say that films that pass the Bechdel test do not have the level of funding available to them as those that do not (for whatever reason), and still tend to do very well in ROI. Hollywood is clearly _very_ sexist, in my opinion, but I'm not sure a lot of specifics can be pulled from this beyond these two conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most interesting trick in the linked analysis is breaking out a return on investment per dollar spent figure, which really clarifies this analysis, for me. Rather than dealing with means and mediand directly, then comparing where the films fall, it's a much more elegant and simple comparison to show one numerical figure to illustrate all of the arguments. Using their plot style/mechanism is also helpful for identifying the distribution of the data."
