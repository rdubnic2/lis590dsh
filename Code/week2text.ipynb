We have to say ```%matplotlib inline``` as a kind of magic word that permits graphs to be displayed in a Jupyter notebook. Then we import a specific subset of matplotlib called \"pyplot.\" We rename it ```plt```, for a shorter convenience name. Then we pass ```plt```'s plot method a list of numbers, which it treats as the y axis values. (If x values aren't provided, it assumes by default that we want a sequence of integers, which in this case is exactly what we do want.) Finally, we have to say ```plt.show()``` to make the image actually appear."
